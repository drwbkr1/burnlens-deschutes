# BurnLens Version History

## Version policy

BurnLens uses the identifier classes in `VERSIONING.md`. A tag records repository state; it does not imply an application, dataset, model, run, public release, operational readiness, or official status.

## Repository baselines

| Identifier | State | Commit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v0.1.0-source-metadata-baseline` | Verified annotated tag | `6abe87bba486e3fe49b6c06178b454335663cb73` | First Phase Two source-readiness package: versioned discovery AOI, three reviewed source records, terms/access/precheck/provenance controls, and a normalized public-metadata fixture. No source assets or analytical capability. |
| `v0.0.8-execution-goal-baseline` | Verified annotated tag | `22a8d88435cb8d5b900a398b7482c3b7277d2ee6` | Controlling execution goal, six-phase roadmap, repository-only product boundary, and active status/log baseline. No analytical capability. |
| `v0.0.7-objective-seven-phase-one-baseline` | Historical candidate only; never created as a tag | Eligible historical target `10caebb3d61ff622dc6dfe8809a63886089eba4e` | Phase One documentation/control candidate approved for Phase Two planning only. |

An authenticated tag inventory at goal activation on 2026-07-13 returned no tag refs. After PR #291 merged, the annotated `v0.0.8-execution-goal-baseline` tag was created, pushed, and independently dereferenced to the exact merge commit. Historical text that treated the tag inventory as inaccessible is superseded for current status, but remains part of the audit trail.

The source-metadata baseline records availability and governance evidence only. It does not imply that any scene contains a Darlene 3 detection, that source assets have been accessed, or that the active-fire target is label-ready.

Every shipped checkpoint must update this file with its version, exact commit, evidence meaning, and explicit non-implications.
