# BurnLens Deschutes

BurnLens Deschutes is an experimental, portfolio-first computer vision and GEOINT project. It is designed to show technical and technical-adjacent reviewers how a bounded wildfire-screening workflow can move from versioned imagery through a segmentation model or justified baseline into transparent, reproducible geospatial evidence.

## Verified status

The project is at a Phase Two source-readiness and intake-reliability baseline, not an analytical release.

- Phase One's documentation and repository-control evidence is complete enough for **Phase Two planning only**, as approved in P1O7-T08 / PR #294 on 2026-07-13.
- The controlling goal remains versioned at `v0.0.8-execution-goal-baseline`; Phase Two metadata discovery, exact asset readiness, delivery integrity, and final-AOI evidence are shipped through P2O2-T01 / PR #322.
- P2O2-T02 / issue #325 / PR #326 is the active `0.3.0` candidate: an exact three-asset intake contract rejects partial or tampered packages and permits raw registration only through one all-or-none atomic promotion. Its proof uses temporary synthetic fixtures; it does not use or validate provider data.
- `v0.1.2-access-integrity-baseline` adds a runnable fail-closed delivery validator and a rendered precheck proving that the exact unauthenticated LP DAAC responses are login HTML rather than source assets.
- `aoi-darlene3-model-v0.2.0` is the accepted final modeling AOI: a reproducible 12 km by 9 km Deschutes County analysis boundary derived from one cited NIFC reference feature. Its normalized report and static evidence map are geometry evidence, not a wildfire result.
- No credential or provider imagery asset has been used or retained. One public NIFC reference vector is checksummed and retained; temporary intake fixtures are deleted after rehearsal. No imagery pixel-processing pipeline, label, dataset, baseline output, trained model, analytical metric, imagery-derived raster/vector, application demonstration, or public analytical result exists yet.
- The latest verified analytical repository baseline is `fffd3dda123d7c43fe678dca9adfd8feb73de158` from issue #321 / PR #322; the annotated `v0.2.0-aoi-baseline` tag resolves to that exact merge commit.
- The next paired source-intake checkpoint is blocked until the owner explicitly approves adding or using both a CDSE credential and a NASA Earthdata Login credential. The exact LP DAAC routes return login responses without Earthdata authentication; NASA-only intake is not a substitute for the pair.

Current truth lives in [the phase-status record](docs/status/PHASE_STATUS.md). The approved execution authority lives in [the BurnLens execution goal](docs/governance/BURNLENS_EXECUTION_GOAL.md).

## Project promise

BurnLens will demonstrate one defensible, traceable CV-to-GEOINT workflow for a bounded Deschutes County study area:

```text
versioned imagery
→ deterministic preprocessing
→ segmentation or justified baseline mask
→ georeferenced raster
→ vector polygons
→ transparent geospatial overlays
→ descriptive exposure-style summary
→ immutable run package
→ repository-owned application and portfolio case study
```

The primary audience is technical and technical-adjacent portfolio reviewers. The reference user evaluates whether the work demonstrates credible computer vision, remote-sensing, geospatial engineering, reproducibility, reliability, and responsible judgment.

## Locked computer-vision task

- **Task:** experimental binary semantic segmentation for wildfire-relevant screening.
- **Primary target:** active-fire / hotspot-informed binary fire mask.
- **Controlled fallback:** burn-scar binary mask, only if Phase Two evidence shows the primary target is too sparse, noisy, misaligned, or otherwise indefensible.
- **Reference model family:** U-Net-style segmentation, evaluated only after a strong non-model baseline.
- **Output posture:** mask-first, georeferenced, uncertainty-aware, and explicit about unknown/excluded areas.

Hotspot detections may support reference, sampling, weak-label, or comparison logic. They are not exact fire perimeters or pixel-perfect ground truth.

## Six outcomes to prove

The [six-phase roadmap](docs/roadmap/BURNLENS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md) is a revisable planning hypothesis. Its task order may change; these outcomes may not change without owner approval.

| Phase | Outcome BurnLens must prove | Current status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The promise, task, source posture, controls, traceability, and acceptance evidence are coherent enough to govern implementation. | Planning baseline accepted and versioned for Phase Two planning; no analytical release. |
| 2 | One legally usable, versioned, leakage-resistant data/label/baseline foundation can support a defensible model-or-stop decision. | Active; the final modeling AOI is shipped, exact routes and open-use terms are verified, and an all-or-none intake transaction is tested without provider bytes. Real intake remains blocked on owner-approved CDSE and Earthdata credentials. |
| 3 | One bounded model either adds reproducible value beyond the strongest baseline or is rejected honestly. | Blocked by Phase Two evidence. |
| 4 | The accepted model or baseline can become a valid, reproducible, georeferenced run and evidence interface. | Blocked by Phase Three/baseline decision. |
| 5 | The integrated system is reproducible, accessible, secure, failure-visible, performant, and reversible. | Blocked by Phase Four. |
| 6 | One coherent, licensed, citable, traceable portfolio release can be published and maintained or closed honestly. | Blocked by Phase Five and publication gates. |

## Repository boundary

This repository owns the full BurnLens product: analytical code, data contracts, model and run artifacts, application, public website, case study, documentation, and release records.

BurnLens execution must not read, change, publish, depend on, or use the separate `burnlens-site` repository. Any future public surface will be built and deployed from `drwbkr1/burnlens-deschutes`.

## Safety and source precedence

> Experimental BurnLens CV output. Not official wildfire information. Not emergency guidance. Not evacuation, routing, tactical, or incident-command support. Official sources govern.

BurnLens is not field-validated, agency-endorsed, operational, emergency-ready, or suitable for property-level, insurance, legal, regulatory, evacuation, routing, tactical, suppression, or incident-command decisions.

Official county, state, federal, fire-service, emergency-management, transportation, air-quality, and incident sources govern whenever they differ from BurnLens-derived output.

## Traceability requirement

Every future public output and claim must trace to its Git commit, application version, AOI version, source records, dataset version, label-schema version, baseline or model version, immutable run ID, processing timestamp, checksums, warning flags, limitations, and source-precedence note. Traceability is required but does not replace licensing, claims review, release QA, or rendered-output verification.

## Active controls

- [Execution goal](docs/governance/BURNLENS_EXECUTION_GOAL.md)
- [Six-phase roadmap](docs/roadmap/BURNLENS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md)
- [Phase status](docs/status/PHASE_STATUS.md)
- [Version history](docs/status/VERSION_HISTORY.md)
- [Versioning protocol](VERSIONING.md)
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
- [Agent instructions](AGENTS.md)
- [Prompt-to-repository SOP](docs/workflows/PROMPT_TO_REPO_SOP.md)

Historical Objective Seven trackers, handoffs, audits, and release notes remain the evidence trail for the Phase One planning-only decision. Their obsolete sequencing and permission limits do not override the execution goal.

## Run the current evidence tools

The executable surface now includes fail-closed access validation, deterministic AOI evidence, and a credential-free exact-pair transaction rehearsal. It is not an analytical wildfire pipeline or application.

The rehearsal command intentionally exits with status `2` while the real package is absent: `BLOCKED_OWNER_CREDENTIAL` is the expected truthful state, not a successful provider intake.

The committed [normalized precheck](samples/access/phase-two/VIIRS-ACCESS-PRECHECK-2026-001.json), [semantic report](samples/access/phase-two/VIIRS-ACCESS-PRECHECK-2026-001.html), and [visual evidence card](samples/access/phase-two/VIIRS-ACCESS-PRECHECK-2026-001.png) record a credential block. They do not contain provider pixels or rejected login-response bodies.

The [final AOI record](records/phase-two/aoi/AOI-2026-002.md), [normalized AOI evidence](samples/aoi/phase-two/AOI-FINAL-2026-001.json), [semantic report](samples/aoi/phase-two/AOI-FINAL-2026-001.html), [visual evidence map](samples/aoi/phase-two/AOI-FINAL-2026-001.png), and [living case study](docs/case-study/BURNLENS_CASE_STUDY.md) explain the source/reference relationship and the remaining credential/data risks. They do not claim a detection, label, model, or operational product.

The [paired-intake decision](docs/phase-two/objective-two/PAIRED_INTAKE_TRANSACTION_DECISION.md), [normalized rehearsal](samples/intake/phase-two/PAIR-INTAKE-REHEARSAL-2026-001.json), [semantic report](samples/intake/phase-two/PAIR-INTAKE-REHEARSAL-2026-001.html), and [rendered evidence card](samples/intake/phase-two/PAIR-INTAKE-REHEARSAL-2026-001.png) show the exact contract, real zero-provider state, and synthetic-only transaction proof. The report pins its public-metadata observation time separately and states that a rehearsal run makes no live provider request. These artifacts do not establish provider delivery or source fitness.
