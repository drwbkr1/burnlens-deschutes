# BurnLens Deschutes

BurnLens Deschutes is an experimental, portfolio-first computer vision and GEOINT project. It is designed to show technical and technical-adjacent reviewers how a bounded wildfire-screening workflow can move from versioned imagery through a segmentation model or justified baseline into transparent, reproducible geospatial evidence.

## Verified status

The project is at a Phase Two source-readiness baseline, not an analytical release.

- Phase One's documentation and repository-control evidence is complete enough for **Phase Two planning only**, as approved in P1O7-T08 / PR #294 on 2026-07-13.
- The controlling goal remains versioned at `v0.0.8-execution-goal-baseline`; Phase Two metadata discovery and exact asset-access readiness are now complete.
- `v0.1.1-asset-readiness-baseline` pins one exact Sentinel-2 product and the closest same-day NOAA-21 VIIRS fire/geolocation pair, with normalized metadata-only evidence and a credential-boundary STOP.
- No credential or provider source asset has been used or retained. No final AOI, label, dataset, runnable pipeline, baseline output, trained model, metric, run, raster, vector, map, application demonstration, or public analytical result exists yet.
- The latest verified repository evidence baseline on `main` is `cf4aba2f40aa426f28f09b1b1b1bad895394198b` from issue #312 / PR #314; the annotated `v0.1.1-asset-readiness-baseline` tag resolves to that commit.
- The next paired source-intake checkpoint is blocked until the owner explicitly approves adding or using a CDSE account/token. NASA-only intake is not a substitute.

Current truth lives in [the phase-status record](docs/status/PHASE_STATUS.md). The approved execution authority lives in [the BurnLens execution goal](docs/governance/BURNLENS_EXECUTION_GOAL.md).

## Project promise

BurnLens will demonstrate one defensible, traceable CV-to-GEOINT workflow for a bounded Deschutes County study area:

```text
versioned imagery
→ deterministic preprocessing
→ segmentation or justified baseline mask
→ georeferenced raster
→ vector polygons
→ transparent geospatial overlays
→ descriptive exposure-style summary
→ immutable run package
→ repository-owned application and portfolio case study
```

The primary audience is technical and technical-adjacent portfolio reviewers. The reference user evaluates whether the work demonstrates credible computer vision, remote-sensing, geospatial engineering, reproducibility, reliability, and responsible judgment.

## Locked computer-vision task

- **Task:** experimental binary semantic segmentation for wildfire-relevant screening.
- **Primary target:** active-fire / hotspot-informed binary fire mask.
- **Controlled fallback:** burn-scar binary mask, only if Phase Two evidence shows the primary target is too sparse, noisy, misaligned, or otherwise indefensible.
- **Reference model family:** U-Net-style segmentation, evaluated only after a strong non-model baseline.
- **Output posture:** mask-first, georeferenced, uncertainty-aware, and explicit about unknown/excluded areas.

Hotspot detections may support reference, sampling, weak-label, or comparison logic. They are not exact fire perimeters or pixel-perfect ground truth.

## Six outcomes to prove

The [six-phase roadmap](docs/roadmap/BURNLENS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md) is a revisable planning hypothesis. Its task order may change; these outcomes may not change without owner approval.

| Phase | Outcome BurnLens must prove | Current status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The promise, task, source posture, controls, traceability, and acceptance evidence are coherent enough to govern implementation. | Planning baseline accepted and versioned for Phase Two planning; no analytical release. |
| 2 | One legally usable, versioned, leakage-resistant data/label/baseline foundation can support a defensible model-or-stop decision. | Active; exact routes and terms verified, provider asset intake blocked on owner-approved CDSE credential. |
| 3 | One bounded model either adds reproducible value beyond the strongest baseline or is rejected honestly. | Blocked by Phase Two evidence. |
| 4 | The accepted model or baseline can become a valid, reproducible, georeferenced run and evidence interface. | Blocked by Phase Three/baseline decision. |
| 5 | The integrated system is reproducible, accessible, secure, failure-visible, performant, and reversible. | Blocked by Phase Four. |
| 6 | One coherent, licensed, citable, traceable portfolio release can be published and maintained or closed honestly. | Blocked by Phase Five and publication gates. |

## Repository boundary

This repository owns the full BurnLens product: analytical code, data contracts, model and run artifacts, application, public website, case study, documentation, and release records.

BurnLens execution must not read, change, publish, depend on, or use the separate `burnlens-site` repository. Any future public surface will be built and deployed from `drwbkr1/burnlens-deschutes`.

## Safety and source precedence

> Experimental BurnLens CV output. Not official wildfire information. Not emergency guidance. Not evacuation, routing, tactical, or incident-command support. Official sources govern.

BurnLens is not field-validated, agency-endorsed, operational, emergency-ready, or suitable for property-level, insurance, legal, regulatory, evacuation, routing, tactical, suppression, or incident-command decisions.

Official county, state, federal, fire-service, emergency-management, transportation, air-quality, and incident sources govern whenever they differ from BurnLens-derived output.

## Traceability requirement

Every future public output and claim must trace to its Git commit, application version, AOI version, source records, dataset version, label-schema version, baseline or model version, immutable run ID, processing timestamp, checksums, warning flags, limitations, and source-precedence note. Traceability is required but does not replace licensing, claims review, release QA, or rendered-output verification.

Historical Objective Seven trackers, handoffs, audits, and release notes remain the evidence trail for the Phase One planning-only decision. Their obsolete sequencing and permission limits do not override the execution goal.
