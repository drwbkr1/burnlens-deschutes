# BurnLens Deschutes

BurnLens Deschutes is an experimental, portfolio-first computer vision and GEOINT project. It is designed to show technical and technical-adjacent reviewers how a bounded wildfire-screening workflow can move from versioned imagery through a segmentation model or justified baseline into transparent, reproducible geospatial evidence.

## Verified status

The project is at a planning/control baseline, not an analytical release.

- Phase One's documentation and repository-control evidence is complete enough for **Phase Two planning only**, as approved in P1O7-T08 / PR #294 on 2026-07-13.
- The planning/control baseline is versioned at `v0.0.8-execution-goal-baseline`; this is not an analytical release or GitHub Release.
- Phase Two data work has not begun.
- No accepted source data, final AOI, labels, dataset, runnable pipeline, baseline output, trained model, metric, run, raster, vector, map, application demonstration, or public analytical result exists yet.
- The latest verified `main` baseline is `22a8d88435cb8d5b900a398b7482c3b7277d2ee6` from merged issue #290 / PR #291.
- The next selected checkpoint is Phase Two source/licensing/access readiness; data remains blocked until terms and before-data evidence are resolved.

Current truth lives in [the phase-status record](docs/status/PHASE_STATUS.md). The approved execution authority lives in [the BurnLens execution goal](docs/governance/BURNLENS_EXECUTION_GOAL.md).

## Project promise

BurnLens will demonstrate one defensible, traceable CV-to-GEOINT workflow for a bounded Deschutes County study area:

```text
versioned imagery
→ deterministic preprocessing
→ segmentation or justified baseline mask
→ georeferenced raster
→ vector polygons
→ transparent geospatial overlays
→ descriptive exposure-style summary
→ immutable run package
→ repository-owned application and portfolio case study
```

The primary audience is technical and technical-adjacent portfolio reviewers. The reference user evaluates whether the work demonstrates credible computer vision, remote-sensing, geospatial engineering, reproducibility, reliability, and responsible judgment.

## Locked computer-vision task

- **Task:** experimental binary semantic segmentation for wildfire-relevant screening.
- **Primary target:** active-fire / hotspot-informed binary fire mask.
- **Controlled fallback:** burn-scar binary mask, only if Phase Two evidence shows the primary target is too sparse, noisy, misaligned, or otherwise indefensible.
- **Reference model family:** U-Net-style segmentation, evaluated only after a strong non-model baseline.
- **Output posture:** mask-first, georeferenced, uncertainty-aware, and explicit about unknown/excluded areas.

Hotspot detections may support reference, sampling, weak-label, or comparison logic. They are not exact fire perimeters or pixel-perfect ground truth.

## Six outcomes to prove

The [six-phase roadmap](docs/roadmap/BURNLENS_BUILD_ROADMAP.md) is a revisable planning hypothesis. Its task order may change; these outcomes may not change without owner approval.

| Phase | Outcome BurnLens must prove | Current status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The promise, task, source posture, controls, traceability, and acceptance evidence are coherent enough to govern implementation. | Planning baseline accepted and versioned for Phase Two planning; no analytical release. |
| 2 | One legally usable, versioned, leakage-resistant data/label/baseline foundation can support a defensible model-or-stop decision. | Planning authorized; data blocked pending before-data evidence and resolved terms. |
| 3 | One bounded model either adds reproducible value beyond the strongest baseline or is rejected honestly. | Blocked by Phase Two evidence. |
| 4 | The accepted model or baseline can become a valid, reproducible, georeferenced run and evidence interface. | Blocked by Phase Three/baseline decision. |
| 5 | The integrated system is reproducible, accessible, secure, failure-visible, performant, and reversible. | Blocked by Phase Four. |
| 6 | One coherent, licensed, citable, traceable portfolio release can be published and maintained or closed honestly. | Blocked by Phase Five and publication gates. |

## Repository boundary

This repository owns the full BurnLens product: analytical code, data contracts, model and run artifacts, application, public website, case study, documentation, and release records.

BurnLens execution must not read, change, publish, depend on, or use the separate `burnlens-site` repository. Any future public surface will be built and deployed from `drwbkr1/burnlens-deschutes`.

## Safety and source precedence

> Experimental BurnLens CV output. Not official wildfire information. Not emergency guidance. Not evacuation, routing, tactical, or incident-command support. Official sources govern.

BurnLens is not field-validated, agency-endorsed, operational, emergency-ready, or suitable for property-level, insurance, legal, regulatory, evacuation, routing, tactical, suppression, or incident-command decisions.

Official county, state, federal, fire-service, emergency-management, transportation, air-quality, and incident sources govern whenever they differ from BurnLens-derived output.

## Traceability requirement

Every future public output and claim must trace to its Git commit, application version, AOI version, source records, dataset version, label-schema version, baseline or model version, immutable run ID, processing timestamp, checksums, warning flags, limitations, and source-precedence note. Traceability is required but does not replace licensing, claims review, release QA, or rendered-output verification.

Historical Objective Seven trackers, handoffs, audits, and release notes remain the evidence trail for the Phase One planning-only decision. Their obsolete sequencing and permission limits do not override the execution goal.
